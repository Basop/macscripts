Re-enable Java
==========

This package will re-enable the built in Java Web Plugin from Apple using a script by [Rich Trouton](https://github.com/rtrouton/rtrouton_scripts/tree/master/rtrouton_scripts/re-enable_java_6). The java-install-check.sh script is for use with Munki as an [installcheck_script](http://code.google.com/p/munki/wiki/SupportedPkginfoKeys).
